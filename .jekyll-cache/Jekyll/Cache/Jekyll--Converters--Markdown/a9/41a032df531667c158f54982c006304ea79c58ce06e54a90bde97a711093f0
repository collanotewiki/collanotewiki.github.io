<p><strong>Short Answer:</strong> If you didnâ€™t backup the file before deleting/reinstalling Collanote, then <strong>NO</strong>, there is no known method to get those note back.</p>

<p><strong>Long Answer:</strong> CollaNote is designed to not store your private files/notes on any server (except your own iCloud Drive and you have to manually choose it, as default is saving locally).<br />
By the menu below, you can choose to save your precious notes on between either <strong>your IPAD</strong> locally, or <strong>YOUR iCloud</strong>

<table class="custom-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center">Menu</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Choice</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Comment</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">Use iCloud Folder as Home Folder</td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><b>OFF</b></td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Your file is stored  <b>locally on your IPAD</b>   (default)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">Â </td>
      <td style="text-align: center"><b>ON</b></td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Your file is stored  <b>on your iCloud Drive</b></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<ul>
  <li>Case you choose to save locally:
    <ul>
      <li>Your file is saved in the following path: Files/ColllaNote</li>
      <li>This folder will <strong>be removed</strong> when you uninstall CollaNote.<br />
(picture local path)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Case you choose to save on iCloud Drive
    <ul>
      <li>Your file is saved in the following path: iCloud Drive/ColllaNote</li>
      <li>This folder <strong>will stay</strong> even after you uninstall CollaNote.<br />
(picture iCloud Drive)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So:
<strong>If you delete the app, all your notes stored locally will be deleted from it</strong><br />
<strong>And if you donâ€™t back up the files â€˜beforeâ€™ deleting the/re-installing CollaNote, then there is NO WAY to get those note back later</strong>
<strong>We donâ€™t store your file on any server, so if you donâ€™t want to lose your note BACKUP those notes BEFORE deleting/re-installing CollaNote</strong></p>
