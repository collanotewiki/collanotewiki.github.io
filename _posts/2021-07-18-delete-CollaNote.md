**Short Answer:** If you didn't backup the file before deleting/reinstalling Collanote, then **NO**, there is no known method to get those note back.

**Short Answer:** If you didn't backup the file before deleting/reinstalling Collanote, then **NO**, there is no known method to get those note back.  

**Long Answer:** CollaNote is designed to not store your private files/notes on any server (except your own iCloud Drive and you have to manually choose it, as default is saving locally).  
By the menu below, you can choose to save your precious notes on between either **your IPAD** locally, or **YOUR iCloud**

| Menu                             | Choice             | Comment                                                    |
|:--------------------------------:|:------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------:|
| Use iCloud Folder as Home Folder | <b>OFF</b>        | Your file is stored  <b>locally on your IPAD</b>   (default)|
|                                  | <b>ON</b>         | Your file is stored  <b>on your iCloud Drive</b>            |

- Case you choose to save locally:  
  - Your file is saved in the following path: Files/ColllaNote  
  - This folder will **be removed** when you uninstall CollaNote.

- Case you choose to save on iCloud Drive  
  - Your file is saved in the following path: iCloud Drive/ColllaNote  
  - This folder **will stay** even after you uninstall CollaNote.

So:
**If you delete the app, all your notes stored locally will be deleted from it**  
**And if you don't back up the files 'before' deleting the/re-installing CollaNote, then there is NO WAY to get those note back later**
**We don't store your file on any server, so if you don't want to lose your note BACKUP those notes BEFORE deleting/re-installing CollaNote**
